## Introduction 

Domus.ai is built by four students in Royal Hackaway in 24 hours. It is a property search web app that helps people to choose properties better suiting their needs. We utilised Python(Taipy), Firebase, Web Scraping Beautiful Soup, Google Maps API, Auth0 for this project. 

## Inspiration

We, the Domus.ai team, felt your pain. That's why we envisioned a friendly AI companion who guides you through the property search maze, understanding your preferences like a best friend would.

## What it does

Domus.ai is more than just a search engine; it's a conversational matchmaker. You like and dislike properties, sharing your vibe with our AI. As you engage, Domus learns your taste for light-filled lofts, cozy cottages, or sleek penthouses. It uses this knowledge to curate personalized recommendations, ensuring you only see what resonates.

## Challenges we ran into

Integrating AI and personalization within such a tight timeframe wasn't easy. Balancing user-friendliness with sophisticated algorithms and data security kept us on our toes. But we embraced the challenge, learning fast and iterating relentlessly until Domus.ai felt intuitive and delightful.

## What we learned

The power of community and collaboration can propel amazing things in a short time. We learned to embrace challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. Most importantly, we discovered that even a complex technology can be infused with personality and warmth, transforming a mundane task into a joyful experience.

## What's next for Domus.ai

We're just getting started! We're expanding our AI's capabilities to understand not just property preferences but also lifestyle factors like commute times and neighborhood amenities. We envision Domus.ai becoming your trusted home-finding confidante, seamlessly connecting you with your perfect space.
